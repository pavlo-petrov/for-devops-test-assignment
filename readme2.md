# Install WordPress

## Schema of Installation

---

## Part #1: Manual Setup

### Step 1.1: Create AWS Account
- Sign up for an AWS account if you don't have one.

### Step 1.2: Create S3 Bucket for Terraform State
- Create an S3 bucket to store your Terraform state.
- Consider using DynamoDB for state locking to prevent concurrent Terraform executions (this will be addressed later).

### Step 1.3: Setup Secrets in GitHub
- Add AWS credentials to GitHub Secrets for secure access.

### Step 1.4: Configure AWS Credentials
- Use the AWS Console to set up credentials for:
  - Docker Hub
  - Database and wp-admin (remember to configure usernames for the database and WordPress later).

### Step 1.5: Create SSH Key for EC2 Instance
- Generate an SSH key for your EC2 instance.
- (Note: Itâ€™s recommended to use Terraform for this, but you can skip regeneration if you already have a key.)

## Part #2: Terraform

1. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply



## Part #3: CI/CD

### Step 3.1: Create Docker Container
- **Objective**: Build a Docker container with the WordPress source code.
- **Action**:
  - Push the Docker container to Docker Hub.
- **Benefits**:
  - Isolation of the site.
  - Facilitates future migrations.

### Step 3.2: Create AMI Image
- **Source**: Utilize `blank-wordpress-code` from a GitHub repository (unzip the archive from WordPress.org).
- **Note**: WordPress requires database connections (MySQL and Redis) to function properly when deployed within AWS.

#### Use the Installation Script
- **Script Path**: `/packer/scripts/install_wordpress.md`
- **Installation Tasks**:
  - Set up the database.
  - Set up Redis.
  - Set up HTTPS plugin (currently not functional; ongoing work).
  - Set up S3 (to be addressed within 1-2 days).

> **Note**: We can use the source code with installed plugins, but the functionality without prior setup is uncertain.

### Step 3.3: Deployment
- **Objective**: Implement green/blue deployment strategy.
- **Action**: Switch running instances in the Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to ensure zero downtime during updates.





Install wordpress

Schema of installation




 
Part #1. Manuel setup

step 1.1
Create AWS account 

Step 1.2.
Create S3 bucket for terraform state
(we need to use some database like dynamodb for protacted of using two teraform at one time .. but not realise this )

Step 1.3 
Setup secrets in github and add AWS credential 

Step 1.4. 
Use AWS consule and setup credential for:
- docker hub;
- daatabase/wp-admin; ( i know we need to setup here usernames for db and wordpress .. but maybe in other time )

Step 1.3. 
Create ssh-key for ec2 instance 
(i know we need to use terraform for this - but i had it and don't want to change every time whan i need to run terraform destroy.. )


Part #2. Terraform 
terraform init 
terraform apply 

(I don't know how to run terraform in CI/CD (do you remember - im only junior) - because this we need to run on your/my local machine.)

Part #3. CI/CD

Step 3.1 
Create a docker container with wordpress's source code and push it to dockerhub.
We need use docker for isolate our site. it gives to us better migration in future. 

Step 3.2
Create ami image. 

I used blank-wordpress-code in github repository (only unzip archive from wordpress.org) 
I don't know how wordpress will works if we setup it untile ci/cd - because it will work without connection to databases: mysql and redis... Because this we need to run inside AWS. 
Inside work subnet. 

For this we use script: /packer/scripts/install_wordpress.md
(I needed to ask developers for this.. but i hadn't one whan i started word on this test)

Use instalation script for install wordpress:
- setup database
- setup redis
- setup https plugin (no-realise - HTTPS doesn't word correct for now. im working on this)
- setup S3 (no-realise for now .. maybe untile 1-2 days)
(i know we can use source code with installed plug-ins and but i don't how i will word if we didn't setup it in )

Step 3.3.
Deploy 
We need to use green/blue deploy for change our running instances in ASG.
